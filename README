== Soccer5

This is a small project I wrote to keep track of our weekly soccer matches. The
application generates an invitation email each week at a configured day/time.
People receiving the email can click on a link in the mail to accept the
invitation or to decline it. The application keep tracks of whom accepted and
sends few emails to communicate that the required number of players has been
reached or that more players are needed.
